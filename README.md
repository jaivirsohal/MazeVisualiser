-This Project consists of a maze visualiser that shows how Prim's algorithm generates mazes.

-This program also shows how different pathfinding algorithms work such as depth-first search, breadth-first search and the A* algorithm.

-The speed of the process may be edited at any time.

-The program also offers a maze game with a timed leaderboard.
